# TechTestFullstack

This is a repository done as a Trial for the Fullstack Developer role. 

The Mains task was basically create a To-Do App (Task Registers) with a CRUD. 

For the front i used ReactJS (axios and redux), for backend SpringBoot (JPA + crudRepository) + And H2 database only for development purposes.

How to Run it: 

The project its on the MASTER branch, i dont know why 2 branch created but anyway. The project is on the MASTER branch
Download both folders and for react proy its just npm start, that should work, and for backend Open the project on Sprint tools suite and then Run it as a Springboot Applicaction.
